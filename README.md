## Overview
Parso is a lightweight Java library that is designed to read SAS7BDAT datasets. The Parso interfaces are analogous to
 those that belong to libraries designed to read table-storing files, for example, CSVReader library. Despite its
 small size, the Parso library is the only full-featured open-source solution to process SAS7BDAT datasets
 (uncompressed, CHAR-compressed or BINARY-compressed). It is effective in processing clinical and statistical data,
 which is often stored in SAS7BDAT format. In addition, the Parso library allows users to convert data into CSV format.

## Why Select Parso as your SAS7BDAT File Reader?
* Stability: Successful processing in difficult cases (partially corrupt files, compression, etc.)
* High processing speed
* Easy-to-use API: You need a couple of lines of program code to convert your SAS7BDAT file into a model or CSV format
* JavaDoc for exposed API
* Algorithm descriptions enclosed
* Evolving project: EPAM continues to develop the library by adding new functionality
* On-going technical support: EPAM welcomes any comments and concerns about this product and will address them on a regular basis
* Possibility of integration with existing client projects
* Row-by-row reading of data allows you to optimally organize the storing of results

## Features
* Data streams processing: no need to save the files to process
* Converting SAS7BDAT datasets into CSV format
* Reading and converting metadata of SAS7BDAT datasets into CSV format
* Extracting all properties of SAS7BDAT files (creation date, modification date, etc.)
* Two ways to read the file data: in one go and row by row

## Support and Development
EPAM has wide experience in integration services and will help you integrate Parso into your project. We will price those services based on your individual needs.

## How to Use
If you use Maven, add the following dependency into the pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.epam</groupId>
    <artifactId>parso</artifactId>
    <version>2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Create a variable of the SasFileReader class and indicate your InputStream that contains the SAS7BDAT file as a parameter in the SasFileReader constructor:
```java
com.epam.parso.SasFileReader sasFileReader = new SasFileReaderImpl(is);
```

To get the properties of a SAS7BDAT file, use:
```java
sasFileReader.getSasFileProperties();
```

To get the description of the SAS7BDAT columns, use:

```java
sasFileReader.getColumns();
```
To get the data of the SAS7BDAT file, use:

```java
sasFileReader.readAll(); //to read all rows at once

sasFileReader.readNext(); //to read rows one by one
```

To convert the metadata of the file into CSV format, use:

```java
Writer writer = new StringWriter();
CSVMetadataWriter csvMetadataWriter = new CSVMetadataWriterImpl(writer);
csvMetadataWriter.writeMetadata(sasFileReader.getColumns());
```
To convert the data of the file into CSV format, use:

```java
Writer writer = new StringWriter();
CSVDataWriter csvDataWriter = new CSVDataWriterImpl(writer);
csvDataWriter.writeColumnNames(sasFileReader.getColumns());
```

To write all rows at once to the ‘writer’ variable:

```java
csvDataWriter.writeRowsArray(sasFileReader.getColumns(), sasFileReader.readAll());
```
To write rows one by one to the ‘writer’ variable:

```java
csvDataWriter.writeRow(sasFileReader.getColumns(), sasFileReader.readNext());
```
